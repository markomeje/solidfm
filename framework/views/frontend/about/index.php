At present we broadcast for 18 hours daily, on the frequency modulation broadcast band of 100.9MHz. From our broadcast studio in GRA, we are close to the central business area of Enugu.</p><br>

					<p>To avert the natural problem of the topography of the city of Enugu and ensure a wide enough reach, our transmitters are located at the peak of Aguabor Hills, in 9th Mile, Ngwo. It might interest the reader to note that this location is the highest point of the Udi escarpment.
					This vantage point gives us an UNASSAILABLE REACH across several states, namely Abia, Anambra, Ebonyi, Imo, Southern Benue and parts of Kogi, Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Delta States.</p><br>

					<p>Solid FM was established with a vision to provide robust quality entertainment, information and education tailored to meet the need of various segments of the listening public. We carry out our business primarily as a dynamic programming content that is engendered by thought-provoking philosophy.</p><br>

					<p>We are poised to serve the blend of conservative middle/working class, business inclined individuals, vibrant urban youthful audience/student population and the critical mass of Corporate/Executive segment within our coverage area, while upholding the highest level of professional ethics.</p><br>

					<p>Solid FM’s overall goal is to be a leading radio station in the ever expanding world. Wouldn’t you join in this endeavor?
					Together we do things better.</p>
